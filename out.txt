The test begins...  now.
:::Atom test:::
 should be '' (empty)
-1 should be '-1'
Dereference test passed
Dereference root test passed
Dereference badvalue test passed

:::Node test:::
root1:

/a1
/a2
/a3

root2:

/b1
/b2
/b3

Move a2 from root1 to root2:
root1:

/a1
/a3

root2:

/b1
/b2
/b3
/a2

Move root1 into root2:
root2:

/b1
/b2
/b3
/a2
/root1
/root1/a1
/root1/a3

Now just a3:
/root1/a3
And again:
/root1/a3

:::Node path test:::
Dereference test #1 pass
Dereference test #2 pass

:::Operator Test:::
The next line should begin with Node::
Node::OperatorEqu: stub: a2
Now let's annoy it...
Node::OperatorEqu: stub: a9er

:::Integer Test:::
Setting i1 to 12 manually.
If '12' = '12' SetValue worked and also GetValueAsStdString worked
Command i2=i1
Integer::OperatorEqu: i1 is an Integer
i2 = '12'; should be 12 if Integer::OperatorEqu is working
Command i1=42
Integer::OperatorEqu: 42 is a Notype
i1 = '12'; should still be 12
Setting i2 to 39 manually.
Command i1-=i2
i1 = '-27'; should be -27 now if OperatorSub is cooperating
Setting i2 to -3 manually.
Command i1*=i2
i1 = '81'; should be 81 now if OperatorMul is cooperating
Setting i2 to 9 manually.
Command i1/=i2
i1 = '9'; should be 9 now if OperatorDiv is cooperating
Setting i2 to 2 manually.
Command i1^=i2
i1 = '81'; should be 81 again if OperatorPow is cooperating
